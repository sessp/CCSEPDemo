# Program Description 
This program is a website that has some other use which is not relevant to the assignment. The functionality that is relevant to the assignment is the logging of incorrect login attempts. When a user completes an invalid login attempt the server logs the inputted username and password. All the usernames and passwords of invalid login attempts are able to be seen by admins when they login. No real world website, or system for that matter, would operate like this. This is simply a proof of concept type of program. In this program when the user enters any password or username other than "admin" it counts as an invalid attempt and thus the attempt is logged.

## About 

Cross-site scripting is a widespread breed of web vulnerabilities which allows hackers to inject malicious code from their untrusted websites into the webpages that are are being viewed by unknowing victims. Second Order cross side scripting is a specific type of XSS attack where the payload is consumed by some inner functionality in the program and affects multiple users when the inner functionality or some other functionality in the program reflects the payload to a number of users. Second Order XSS is not instaneous and it can take a significant amount of time before the program uses the inner functionality and reflects the payload back at unsuspecting users.
